# codewars

A collection of code challenges from [CodeWars](https://codewars.com).  I thought this would be a great opportunity to practice test-driven development and learn Python along the way!

## Usage

### JavaScript

Challenges written in JavaScript are tested using Mocha and Expect.

```
$ npm run test
```

### Python

I'm sure Python has testing tools; just haven't discovered them yet. ;)

```
$ python file.py
```
